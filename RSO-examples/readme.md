# Sustainability Reporting Standards Knowledge Graph (RSOKG)

## Description

The RSOKG encompasses 114 quantitative indicators sourced from the GRI and ESRS standards, focusing on environmental topics such as materials, energy use, emissions, and waste. These topics hold particular significance within the manufacturing domain, hence their selection. Additionally, RSOKG contains reporting values extracted from a publicly accessible sustainability report of a manufacturing firm based in Germany, available on its website. The report was published in 2022 and complies with the GRI standards.
